# About Uber application

Uber is a transportation and delivery service application that provides professional drivers to transport passengers from one place to another. Users can request an Uber car through the app and specify the current location and destination. The application also allows you to know the driver's details such as his name, photo, and rating by other users. Uber is one of the most popular transportation and delivery applications around the world and is available in many countries and cities.
# About our project:
In our small project, we started with an introduction to the importance of mobility and explained its importance in human life. Then we mentioned the problems that the application solves and how to solve them. We developed a work plan to implement the application project and mentioned the functional and non-functional requirements. To facilitate understanding the relationship between these requirements, we used diagrams.

In addition, we used graphs to design UI models for the Sehati app, which illustrates the flow of interaction between patients, medical staff and support within the Sehati app.

In general, our project involved defining requirements, both functional and non-functional requirements, and designing solutions to solve the problems that the application aims to address. Using diagrams, we can easily visualize the relationship between requirements and prioritize, leading to a more efficient development process.
